The navel is a large, seedless, thick-skinned orange that is easily peeled and segmented making it a very popular fruit to eat on the go. Itâ€™s a well-known fact that oranges are an excellent source of Vitamin C. One medium sized orange can provide enough Vitamin C to meet your recommended daily dose. The Navel orange got its name from the signature â€œbellybuttonâ€ that appears on the blossom end of this variety. Because of its sweet, juicy, delicious taste, the Navel is best for eating fresh out of hand. Although you can juice a Navel orange, over time the juice turns bitter even if itâ€™s refrigerated so be sure to squeeze Navel orange juice as needed and drink it right away for the best flavor. Navels are also a great, healthy way to add flavor to your favorite salads, entrees, and desserts.Product Features:OrangesHealthy snackingSource of Vitamin CHigh in fiberLow in cholesterol",

And even though Dan is all grown up, the ghosts of the Overlook—and his father’s legacy of alcoholism and violence—kept him drifting aimlessly for most of his life. Now, Dan has finally found some order in the chaos by working in a local hospice, earning the nickname “Doctor Sleep” by secretly using his special abilities to comfort the dying and prepare them for the afterlife. But when he unexpectedly meets twelve-year-old Abra Stone—who possesses an even more powerful manifestation of the shining—the two find their lives in sudden jeopardy at the hands of the ageless and murderous nomadic tribe known as the True Knot, reigniting Dan’s own demons and summoning him to battle for this young girl’s soul and survival...Product Features:Genre: Adult FictionTrade PaperbackAuthor: Stephen KingPages: 560",

At first, Lo’s stay is nothing but pleasant: the cabins are plush, the dinner parties are sparkling, and the guests are elegant. But as the week wears on, frigid winds whip the deck, gray skies fall, and Lo witnesses what she can only describe as a dark and terrifying nightmare: a woman being thrown overboard. The problem? All passengers remain accounted for—and so, the ship sails on as if nothing has happened, despite Lo’s desperate attempts to convey that something (or someone) has gone terribly, terribly wrong…Product Features:Genre: Adult FictionTrade PaperbackAuthor: Ruth WarePages: 384",

    "Description": "Using the past as a road map to navigate the complexities of today’s turn toward authoritarianism, this riveting book is a disturbing history of 1930s Britain, revealing how prominent Fascist sympathizers nearly succeeded in overturning democracy.\n\n“Confirms not only the danger British Fascists posed to the nation but also the government’s embarrassing, often inexplicable unwillingness to take steps against them. . . . A cautionary tale for today, when Democratic institutions are fragile and many of the problems roiling the waters of the ’30s are ascendant again.”—Library Journal\n\nHitler’s Girl is a groundbreaking history that reveals how, in the 1930s, authoritarianism almost took hold in Great Britain as it did in Italy and Germany. Drawing on recently declassified intelligence files, Lauren Young details how sympathy for the Nazi cause pervaded the British aristocracy, with significant factions of the upper class actively and methodically pursuing a pro-German agenda. Young exposes the involvement of secret organizations such as the Right Club, which counted the Duke of Wellington among its influential members; the Cliveden Set, which ran a shadow foreign policy supporting Hitler; and the shocking relationship between the socialite Unity Mitford and Adolf Hitler.\n\nEye-opening and instructive, Hitler’s Girl reevaluates 1930s England to help us understand our vulnerabilities today, including the Russian oligarchy and the invasion of Ukraine, Brexit, and the election of Donald Trump. These threats to our postwar democratic traditions mirror aspects of England’s own prewar clandestine reality and raise disturbing questions: At what point does complacency become complicity, posing a real risk to the democratic norms that we take for granted? Is a cataclysmic event like World War II needed to reassess and ensure democracy’s survival? Will we, in our own defining moment, stand up for democratic values—or will we succumb to political extremism?Product Features:Genre: Adult Non-FictionTrade PaperbackAuthor: Lauren YoungPages: 256",

    "Description": "#1 New York Times bestselling author Sandra Brown returns with a fast-paced, emotional thriller where the lives of a young mother and a high-rolling consultant collide under devastating circumstances—culminating in a desperate manhunt that will change their futures forever.\n \nAt a Texas county fair, amidst carousels and a bustling midway, children’s book author Elle Portman is enjoying a rare night out with her favorite cowboy: her two-year-old son, Charlie. But just as they’re about to head home, the unthinkable happens: a shooter opens fire into the crowd, causing widespread panic to erupt all around them.\n\nAlso caught in the melee was corporate consultant Calder Hudson. Arrogant, self-centered, and high off his latest career win, he’s frustrated and confused when he wakes up in the hospital after undergoing emergency surgery on his arm.  The doctor tells him that he was lucky—that as far as gunshot wounds go, he pulled through remarkably well.  Others weren’t so lucky, which instills in Calder a furious determination to get justice . . . a goal shared by Elle.\n\nTheir chance encounter at the police station leads to a surprising and inexplicable gravitation to one another, but even as the attraction grows, Elle and Calder can’t help but wonder if the unimaginable tragedy that brought them together is too painful and too complicated to sustain—especially while the shooter remains at large.Product Features:Genre: Adult FictionHardcoverAuthor: Sandra BrownPages: 416",

    "Description": "From #1 New York Times bestselling author Danielle Steel comes an uplifting novel about an author who—to her surprise—inherits a grand estate near London.\n\nSabrina Brooks is a wildly successful, bestselling author of gripping thrillers. Unlike her fictional characters, Sabrina lives a quiet life in the Berkshires with her two beloved dogs. But behind this peaceful exterior is a dark, painful past. As a child raised by an emotionally distant father, Sabrina rarely felt love. And as an adult, her marriage twisted into an abusive relationship from which she had to escape.\n\nSabrina channeled that fear into her writing, and now she has everything she’s ever wanted. Until the arrival of a mysterious letter disrupts it all, declaring that Sabrina, as the only living relative of her recently deceased uncle, is now the heir to his title and estate outside London. This shocking news forces her to cross the Atlantic and see the manor for herself, stirring up her father’s past and the secrets he kept.\n\nDetermined to sell the estate quickly and return home, Sabrina is surprised by how much she loves roaming the gardens and exploring the historic manor. She can’t help but admire her surroundings, especially with the handsome estate attorney, Grayson Abbott, acting as her tour guide. As she learns more about the family history, Sabrina begins to wonder what life would be like as “Lady Brooks,” and if she could upend the stability she has worked so hard for.  Is she brave enough to choose a different path?\n\nIn Happiness, Danielle Steel creates an unforgettable story about inner strength, following your joy, and the rejuvenating power of love.Product Features:Genre: Adult fictionHardcoverAuthor: Danielle SteelPages: 256",

    "Description": "Liquid Collagen Skin Revitalization Collagen may be the most important element of human skin. This complex protein makes up nearly 80% of skin and provides structure, elasticity and protection while helping to retain moisture within the deep dermal layers.* As aging occurs, collagen naturally decreases over time. Sooner or later, the reduction of collagen causes skin to become thinner, drier and more fragile. Loss of collagen is believed to be the primary cause of fine lines and wrinkles that occur in naturally aged skin.*  Hydrolyzed Collagen: a full 4,000 mg to help replenish the body’s supply of collagen.  Biotin: the essential super beauty nutrient. Horsetail: nutrient-dense botanical and natural source of Silica.  Antioxidant Blend: a combination of superfruits and green tea extract to help protect skin from the damaging effects of free-radicals.  Do not use if you may become pregnant, are pregnant or nursing. Do not exceed recommended daily intake. Not intended for use by persons under 18. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.

    "Description": "Your heart, which needs a constant supply of energy, has the highest concentration of CoQ10 among all of the tissues in your body. Supplementing with CoQ10 has been shown to improve oxygen utilization and energy production in heart muscle cells. CoQ10 may play a vital role in helping to maintain healthy blood pressure levels.\n\n#1 CARDIOLOGIST RECOMMENDED FORM OF COQ10* With superior absorption compared to regular CoQ10, Qunol® Liquid CoQ10 can help you reach optimal levels of Coenzyme Q10 sooner, so you can experience the potential benefits faster. Our patented formulation is 100% water and fat-soluble, unlike regular CoQ10 that does not dissolve in water and dissolves very poorly in fat. \n \nBENEFICIAL TO STATIN DRUG USERS* Both cholesterol and CoQ10 are produced in the same pathway. Because statins work by blocking this pathway, they also block the production of CoQ10. Statin medications have been shown to lower CoQ10 levels and the addition of a CoQ10 supplement to statin drug therapy can help replenish lost CoQ10\n \nQunol® Liquid CoQ10 is made with natural sweeteners and flavors. It is naturally sweetened with monk fruit juice instead of sucralose and has a natural orange-pineapple flavor. \n\n*Statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.Instructions for use: For 100mg: adults take two teaspoons (10mL) before, with, or after a meal, or as recommended by your healthcare professional. For 200mg: adults take four teaspoons (20mL) before, with, or after a meal, or as recommended by your healthcare professional.Product Features:#1 cardiologist recommended form of CoQ10Superior absorption - 3x better absorption than regular CoQ10Natural sweeteners & flavorsEssential for energy productionPowderful antioxidantSupports heart and vascular healthBeneficial to statin drug usersPromotes healthy blood pressure levelsOrange pineapple flavorIncludes Qunol liquid CoQ10 100mg 30.4 oz.Product Warnings and Restrictions:Keep Out of Reach of Children; if You Are Pregnant or Nursing, Seek the Advice of a Healthcare Professional Before Using This Product; Keep Bottle Tightly Closed When Not in Use.
